# PyReigns

This is a Python clone of the game, Tinder-style swiping story game, Reigns.

I created this clone to provide an interactive way for people to experience content
from Neighborly. Noah Wardwrip-Fruin gave me this idea during one of our meetings.

## To-Do's

### Major list

- [ ] Add yes/no prompts that appear when the card center position reaches left/right thresholds
- [x] Trigger an event when the card is moved past the left/right thresholds and released

### Minor list

- [ ] Add text alignment options and center the prompt text
- [x] Add rotation to card sprite as it moves away from the center
- [ ] Constrain card movement along a single arc and change y-position based on the dy of the mouse position
